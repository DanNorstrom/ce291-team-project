# ce291-team-project University Collaboration Exercise
Story: The Education Committee (EC) of the CSEE department require a tool to help them analyse student marks data from previous years. This will help the planning of future modules to include into the CSEE degree, and to fine tune existing modules to make their difficulty levels more appropriate.  It also will allow identification of any weak or strong areas of teaching, so that high teaching standards can be maintained.
